mysql_objs.pl

   Helper script used to query the metadata schema
   "information_schema" in a MySQL instance and pull out the objects
   of interest: tables, views, procedures and functions. This is a
   recreation of a script I had done before, to assist as a DBE and
   to ease keeping the DB source code in version control.

randpass.pl

   For the obligatory picking of passwords: allows overall size
   limits, and outputs in chunks as well as a copy/paste block.  No
   special characters in the original set, but that's easily tweakable.

spinny/

   A genetic algorithm to choose letters for a child's early-reading
   toy.
